This project includes data cleaning and descriptive bivariate analysis of a dataset named "Grupo10".

### Dataset

The "Grupo10" dataset includes information about a group of individuals, such as their age, sex, study hours, sleep hours, social media usage hours, and TV watching hours. It also includes their responses to several burnout-related questions.

### Cleaning Data

In the first part of the project, the data was cleaned to remove any values that were not within the expected range of hours. For example, any study or sleep hours that were greater than 24 were replaced with "NA". This was done to ensure that the data used in the analysis was accurate and reliable.

### Descriptive Bivariate Analysis

In the second part of the project, a descriptive bivariate analysis was performed to explore the relationship between two variables in the dataset.

In the first part of the analysis, the mean sleep hours for each age group in the dataset were calculated and displayed in a table. In the second part of the analysis, the mean study hours for males and females in the dataset were compared, and the percentage difference was calculated and displayed in a table. In the third part of the analysis, a contingency table and bar plot were created to visualize the distribution of burnout-related responses for males and females in the dataset.

### Regression Analysis

In the last part of the project, a simple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between two variables in the dataset. Specifically, the relationship between TV watching hours and sleep hours was examined and hours in social media and sleeping. A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship, and a linear model was fitted to the data. The coefficient of determination (R-squared) was calculated to determine the strength of the relationship.

### Conclusion

Overall, this project provides an example of how to clean and analyze a dataset using R. The results of the analysis can be used to gain insights into the relationships between variables in the dataset and to inform future decision-making processes.
