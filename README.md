# Project Title

This is a project for IE class that involves multiple parts, all implemented in R.

## Description

The project is designed to simulate a manufacturing process and analyze its performance using various techniques and tools. The project consists of multiple parts, each representing a different stage in the process.

## Data file

In this file, we have the dataset in study, the survey in study, and the Project Guide.

## Parts

### Part 1: Data Cleaning, Univariate and Bivariate Descriptive Analysis, and Linear Regression

The first part of the project involves cleaning the data so that we can get correct results. It also includes performing univariate and bivariate descriptive analysis to gain insights into the variables. Additionally, a linear regression analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between variables.

### Part 2: Statistical Analysis

The second part of the project focuses on statistical analysis techniques to draw conclusions and make inferences based on the data. This involves calculating confidence intervals, conducting hypothesis testing, and analyzing the results.

## Technologies Used

The project is implemented using R programming language and the following libraries:

- dplyr
- ggplot2
- pander

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages (dplyr, ggplot2, pander).
3. Run the main script for each part of the project.
